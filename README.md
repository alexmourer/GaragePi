Garage Door Sensor Program

Simple garage door sensor program built with a Raspberry Pi and PiFace 2. The program cycles through my two garage bay doors and the garage back door to see if the contact has been broken. If the contact has been broken it will send a text message alerting what door was opened and what time that door opened. The program will continue to send alerts every 15 minutes that the door is open. 

Future plans include:


-Web UI to see if door is open/closed

-Open and close doors via Web UI

-Camera action when door opens
